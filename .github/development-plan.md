4. **Data Integrity**: Never lose user's collection or deck data
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive interface inspired by FaBrary

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Unit tests for data models and API integration
- [ ] Integration tests for import/export functionality
- [ ] End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- [ ] Performance testing with large datasets
- [ ] Cross-browser and mobile device testing

### Documentation
- [ ] API documentation for YGOPRODeck integration
- [ ] User guide for binder and deck management
- [ ] Developer documentation for future contributors
- [ ] Deployment and maintenance guides

## Recommended Development Order

**Start Here**: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
**Core MVP**: Phases 1-4 provide a fully functional deck builder
**Enhancement**: Phases 5-6 add polish and advanced features
**Future Growth**: Phase 7 enables social and collaborative features

Each phase should be completed and tested before moving to the next phase to ensure a stable foundation for subsequent development.
