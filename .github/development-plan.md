<!-- No. You made the change to include images and numbers at the top right which I appreciate, but we need to work on this UI much more. 

Card images are way too small, I can barely make them out

Card images in search are overlapping eachother and I cant tell when I am looking at

The Deck Statististics is in an awkward spot lets make it its own section above and give it the space it deserves, make it collapsable -->
